Test script for Subpage module
==============================

The following test script is designed to check all features of the subpage.

Test case general info
======================

Each section has a unique (within this test case) three letter code and the
steps are numbered so that the location where a failure occurs can be reported.

Steps are shown in the following format:

XXX01 / U.S1 [change]
  Do something
  - Check something

The unique step number is followed by the user that you should be logged
in as for that step. If the user changes from the previous step, the word
[Change] will be noted.

Some steps don't have specific items to check. In that case, the check
'passes' if there are no errors or warnings while completing the task.

The first two stages SUB and BSC are required for each other stage. After that,
other stages are independent of each other.

Note that the test script suggests specific names for things like courses,
users, labels, etc. You can of course ignore these and use different names.

System settings
===============

After making a Moodle 2 install, apply the following changes while leaving other
settings at default values. (These settings may already be set on the test server
but you probably should verify them before beginning testing. All settings are
controlled via the 'Site administration' area.)

Under Developer/Debugging, ensure that debug level is set to 'Developer' and
set to display messages. Any error or warning displayed during the test script
is a failure.

Under Advanced features, ensure that Enable completion tracking and Enable
conditional access are enabled.

Under Development/Experimental settings, ensure that Enable group members only
is enabled.

Under Appearance/Ajax and Javascript ensure the admin option enablecourseajax is on
(I think this is on by default).

Search for 'requiremodintro' in the admin settings box at bottom left and turn
off all checkboxes if necessary.

Check that the subpage module is installed.

Initial setup
=============

Create a test course with shortname 'SUBPAGE'.
  In the course edit page ensure group mode is set to visible groups
  and completion tracking is set to enabled.

Under Settings/Users/Groups create the grouping G and group G1, then
place G1 in the grouping G.

Create the following users:
  U.ET (an [editing] teacher).
  U.S1 (a student) who should be added to group G1.
  U.S2 (another student) who does not belong to any group.
  If the course short name is SUBPAGE then you can use the following CSV script
  to upload users:
username,password,firstname,lastname,course1,role1,group1,email
uet,A1;apple,U,ET,SUBPAGE,editingteacher,,x@x.x
us1,A1;apple,U,S1,SUBPAGE,student,G1,x1@x.x
us2,A1;apple,U,S2,SUBPAGE,student,,x2@x.x
  The user U.ET should have AJAX enabled, but I think this is default.

Enrol the users on the course SUBPAGE

Test script
===========

This script should take a bit over an hour, although times are very roughly
estimated.

Create subpages (~4m)
---------------
(When options for the create form are not specifically mentioned, the defaults
should be left.)

CRE01 / U.ET
  On the course in the top section, create a new subpage called SP1 with
  default settings and no intro.

CRE02 / U.ET
  Create a new subpage called SP2:
  - Verify that the grouping option is available (may require clicking
  Advanced button, if applicable), but greyed out.
  - Verify that the 'group members only' option is available.
  - Verify that turning on the 'group members only' option causes the
  grouping dropdown to become active.
  Select grouping G in the grouping dropdown.

CRE03 / U.ET
  Create a new subpage called SP3:
  Enter the text INTRO into the intro box.
  In the completion options selection, choose the automatic option
  ('when conditions are met').
  - Verify that the 'when viewed' tickbox is available. Tick it.

Basic editing and adding content (~4m)
--------------------------------

EDT01 / U.ET
  On the course page, turn editing on. Click on SP1.
  - Verify that the resulting page includes the subpage title (in crumb
  trail), a single empty section box, a text box hinting "Section title" and
  an 'Add section' button.
  - Verify that the empty section box appears essentially the same as a
  section box on the main course page, with the exception that it does not
  display a section number or date. It should include an edit icon that can be
  used to edit the section title and summary, and dropdowns that can be used to
  add resources or activities.

EDT03 / U.ET
  Click the Resource dropdown to add a label.
  - Verify that the editing page URL is in standard Moodle code and contains
  a returnto parameter.
  Set the label content to LABEL and click save.
  At this point the browser may return to the course URL rather than the
  subpage URL. Return to the subpage manually.
  - Verify that the label LABEL now appears within the section and contains
  standard edit icons.

EDT04 / U.ET
  Click the Activities dropdown to add a forum.
  - Verify that the editing page URL is in standard Moodle code and contains
  a returnto parameter.
  Set the name to FORUM and click save.
  At this point the browser may return to the course URL rather than the subpage
  URL. Return to the subpage manually.
  - Verify that the forum FORUM now appears within the section and contains
  standard edit icons.

Activity editing icons (~10m)
----------------------

AEI01 / U.ET
  Click the Edit icon next to the forum.
  - Verify that the same edit form appears.
  Change the forum name to BASILICA. Hit save.
  At this point the browser may return to the course URL rather than the subpage URL.
  Return to the subpage manually.
  - Verify that the forum name has changed to BASILICA.

AEI02 / U.ET
  Mouse over the Indent (right arrow) icon next to the forum.
  - Verify that it points to a standard Moodle URL but contains a returnto parameter.
  Click the icon.
  At this point the browser may return to the course URL rather than the subpage URL.
  Return to the subpage manually.
  - Verify that the forum has now been indented.
  - Repeat with the Un-indent (left arrow) icon.

AEI03 / U.ET
  Mouse over the visibility (eye) icon next to the label.
  - Verify that it points to a standard Moodle URL but contains a returnto parameter.
  Click the icon.
  At this point the browser may return to the course URL rather than the subpage URL.
  Return to the subpage manually.
  - Verify that the eye has now closed, indicating the label is invisible.
  - Repeat and verify that the eye opens again.

AEI04 / U.ET
  Mouse over the groups (person) icon next to the forum.
  - Verify that it points to a standard Moodle URL but contains a returnto parameter.
  Click the icon.
  At this point the browser may return to the course URL rather than the subpage URL.
  Return to the subpage manually.
  - Verify that the icon has changed to the 'visible groups' icon.
  - Repeat; it should change to separate groups.
  - Repeat again, it should return to the no groups icon.

AEI05 / U.ET
  Click on the 'Assign roles' icon next to the forum.
  - Verify that the standard Moodle assign roles page appears and that it is
  assigning roles for the named forum (BASILICA). (Because there is no way to
  'continue' after assigning roles, there is no need for a returnto parameter.)
  Return to subpage using browser controls.

AEI06 / U.ET
  Click the Delete icon next to the label.
  - Verify that the standard Moodle confirm prompt appears, served from a standard
  Moodle URL, and contains a returnto parameter.
  Click Yes on the confirm prompt.
 At this point the browser may return to the course URL rather than the subpage URL.
  Return to the subpage manually.
  - Verify that the label has now been deleted.

Basic section editing (~3m)
---------------------

SEC01 / U.ET
  Click the edit icon to edit the section.
  - Verify that the URL is that of the standard Moodle script to edits section options,
  rather than any code within subpage.
  - Verify that the page parameters include a returnto URL that points to the correct subpage.
  Set the title to TITLE and the summary to SUMMARY and click save.
  At this point the browser may return to the course URL rather than the subpage URL.
  Return to the subpage manually.
  - Verify that the section now shows the title TITLE and summary SUMMARY.
  HTML formatting should be essentially the same as an equivalent section on the
  main page. Appearance may differ slightly depending on theme.

SEC02 / U.ET
  Click the Add button to add a new section.
  - Verify that the page reloads immediately.
  - Verify that a new empty section has appeared below the existing one.
  - Verify that the new section does not have a title or summary.

SEC03 / U.ET
  Click the edit icon next to the second section, set the title to FROG, and click save.
  At this point the browser may return to the course URL rather than the subpage URL.
  Return to the subpage manually.
  - Verify that the second section now correctly has title FROG and no summary,
  while the first one still has TITLE and SUMMARY.

Move items [JS on] (~10m)
----------
(Before trying this section it may be worth verifying that AJAX is enabled correctly:
go to the course page and check that moving an item works by drag and drop.
The 'Shift-Reload' sequence refers to holding Shift while clicking the Reload browser
button with the mouse. There are other ways to trigger the same 'really reload' action.)

MVJ01 / U.ET
  Add three new activities (any type, e.g. web page) to the top section.
  These should be named FROG, TOAD, and ZOMBIE. The initial list of activities
  should be BASILICA, FROG, TOAD, ZOMBIE in the first section, and no items
  in the second section.
  - Verify that each item has a four-directional 'move' arrow.

MVJ02 / U.ET
  Click and drag the move arrow next to the BASILICA item to move it to the end
  of the first section, then release the mouse button.

MVJ08 / U.ET
  Move the items ZOMBIE and BASILICA back into the top section so that the
  resulting order is [BASILICA, FROG, TOAD, ZOMBIE], [], []. (This is really
  just to get things back into the same place for the start of the next test.)

Move items [JS off] (~6m)
----------
(Before starting this sequence, disable JavaScript using browser settings.
Don't make any other change to Moodle or user settings.)

MVN01 / U.ET
  Reload the page.
  - Verify that the four-directional move arrows do not appear but instead
  there are two-directional move arrows by each item, and up/down arrows on the
  sections. The top section doesn't have an up arrow and the bottom section
  doesn't have a down arrow.

MVN02 / U.ET
  Click the move icon next to BASILICA.
  - Verify that the page reloads with 'target' icons at the start of the
  first section, after each activity in the first section, and in each of
  the other two sections.

  to 'manual' (user can mark complete).
  Create forum on that page called PANTHEON and set its completion settings
  to automatic, system marks complete when user views it.

COM02 / U.S1
  Look at course main page.
  - Verify that subpage SP3 has an 'unticked' icon to the right of it.
  (The icon might be impossible to see, depending on your theme, as it may be
  a white square; mouse around to find it.)

COM03 / U.S1
  Click to view SP3. Then use the breadcrumb trail or navigation block to click
  back to the course main page (do not use browser Back button).
  - Verify that subpage SP3 now has a 'ticked' icon to the right of it.

  Make sure editing is turned on, then view SP1.
  - Verify that links 'Move items to this page' and 'Move items from this page'
  are visible at bottom.
  For testing, add a label to this page. The label should have very long text,
  such as the following:
    It was a dark and stormy night; the rain fell in torrents — except at occasional
    intervals, when it was checked by a violent gust of wind which swept up the streets
    (for it is in London that our scene lies), rattling along the housetops, and fiercely
    agitating the scanty flame of the lamps that struggled against the darkness.
  - Verify that the label displays correctly with text wrapping as normal.
