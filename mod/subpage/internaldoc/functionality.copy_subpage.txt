Subpage: Copying subpages functionality
=========================================

It is not possible to directly copy a single subpage using Moodle backup/restore tools.

Subpage has its own mechanism to do this (which automates Moodle backup/restore) and this
can be accessed from the 'Copy subpage' link in the 'Administration' block.

When copying a subpage all content within the subpage will be included.
User data is not included for any activities, apart from Glossaries that
have no student editing role.
Any subpages within the content will also be included (and sub, sub, sub pages etc).

The subpage copy will be added to section 0 of the target course and be hidden.

Capabilities
------------

In order to copy a subpage you must have moodle/backup:backupsection
and moodle/backup:backupactivity capabilities at current subpage level.

In order to copy into a course you must have moodle/restore:restoreactivity
and moodle/restore:restoresection at the target course level.

User interface
--------------

On access the page will show a list of courses available that the subpage
can be copied to. This can be searched (it is the same as on the Moodle restore page).

A backup and restore of the subpage will then be carried out.
