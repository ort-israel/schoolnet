Subpage: Add section functionality
==================================

"Section title" field has been added to Subpage to allow Subpage creators
to be able to add a section on a Subpage and give that section a title
directly on Subpage view page (when the editing is turned on).

User interface
--------------

Subpage creators (course team members) will find the new text field
just before (on the left of) the "Add section" button.
This field is set with a placeholder indicating "Section title" where
they can type the required section title and then press the "Add section"
button. This action is equivalent to the following steps:
1) Pressing "Add section" button
    (before these changes, or leaving the Section title empty)
2) Clicking on "Edit summary" icon
3) Unchecking "Use default section name" checkbox
4) Typing required section title in "Section name" field
5) Pressing "Save changes" button

In other words, new changes make adding sections faster and easier:

1) Typing required section title in field with placeholder
    "Section title" (empty by default)
2) Pressing "Add section" button

and Subpage creators will stay on the same page while adding sections (with
or without section title).
