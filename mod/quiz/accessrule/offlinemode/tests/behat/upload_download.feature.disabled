Feature: Download responses, encrypted, on the client-side, and re-upload.
  In order to attempt quizzes with dodgy wifi that dies and never comes back
  As a student or invigilator
  I need to be able to download my responses on the client-side, and later upload them to the quiz.

# This feature is not currently working in any browser, even though it used to work.
# At some point it should be fixed, and renamed back to .feature.
#
# In Chrome, the 'I simulate losing the network by changing the submit URL' step
# fails silently, so then the test crashes out at 'I follow the emergency download link'
# since that link does not exist.
#
# In PhantomJS, it crashes at the 'I follow the emergency download link' step, with
# and error saying that the link is not visible, when it can be clearly seen in
# the screen grab.
#
# I can't get Firefox to work right now.
