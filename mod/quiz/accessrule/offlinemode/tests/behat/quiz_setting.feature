Feature: Fault-tolerant mode quiz setting
  In order to run quizzes with dodgy wifi
  As a teacher
  I need to turn the fault-tolerant quiz mode on and off.

  Background:
    Given the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname | shortname | format |

      | teacher | C1     | editingteacher |
    And I log in as "teacher"
    And I follow "Course 1"

  @javascript
  Scenario: Create a quiz with the setting on.
    When I turn editing mode on

      | Experimental fault-tolerant mode | Yes                           |
    And I follow "Quiz with fault-tolerant mode"
    And I navigate to "Edit settings" node in "Quiz administration"
