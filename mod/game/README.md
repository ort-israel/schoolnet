Created by:
      Vasilis Daloukas (bdaloukas)

Many ideas and code were taken from other Moodle modules and Moodle itself

Installation:

This module gets input from quiz, glossary or questions and plays some games. The games are:

* hangman
* crossword
* cryptex
* millionaire
* sudoku
* Snakes and Ladders
* The hidden picture
* Book with questions

If you like the idea goto http://play2learn.gr/moodle for a demo in Moodle 1.9 or goto to http://ebusiness-lab.epdo.teimes.gr/play2learn/ for a demo in Moodle 2.

Currently works with 17 languages Català (ca), Deutsch (de), Ελληνικά (el), English (en), Español - Internacional (es), Euskara (eu), Français (fr), ית  (he), Hrvatski (hr), Italiano (it), Nederlands (nl), Norsk - bokmal ( no), Polski (pl), Português - Brasil (pt_br), Русский (ru), Shqip (sq), Українська (uk), 简体中文 (zh_cn) languages.

Interface:

    * The interface is like a quiz. The student plays games and teacher can see the grades
    * You can set a text that will be visible at the bottom of the game. In this way will be a picture at the bottom and a crossword with questions about the picture
    * You can use pictures inside questions


Restrictions:

    * You can only backup/restore the data of game not the user attempts. (not works backup now)
    * In the report overview you can see only what students said for questions not for glossaryentries

    * Delete the files from mod/game
    * Copy the new files to mod/game
