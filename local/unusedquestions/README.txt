Used/ Unused Question search module for Moodle (http://moodle.org/) - Copyright (C) 2015 Ray Morris
Extends the Moodle question bank to find questions which are / are not used in a quiz.

This may be useful when adding questions to a quiz - no need to add questions which are already in the quiz.
It may also be useful to determine if some questions should be removed or moved, since they aren't being used.
