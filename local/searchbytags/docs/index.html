    <h2 id="whatare">What tags are</h2>
    <p>
        Within the Moodle LMS, various types of objects can be marked with <em>tags</em>. 
        Tags are short keyword labels which tell us something about the object. You may have seen 
        them used on web sites like Flickr or del.icio.us, or you may be familiar with the similar 
        concept of <em>#hashtags</em> from Twitter, Facebook or Instagram. On Flickr, a popular tag is 
        <code>California</code>, indicating a photo of something related to the state of California.
        Within Moodle, tags can be applied to quiz questions, users, courses, and other items in the LMS.
        This document discusses using tags with quiz questions.
    </p>

    <h2 id="howused">How tags can be used with quiz questions</h2>
    <p>
        Tags can be useful to help label and find questions in a large question bank. For example, if you
        had a question bank with questions about the the Texas A&amp;M System, some of those questions may
        specifically be about TEEX. Some questions may be about the history of the system, other questions
        might be about TEEX history. You could tag those questions <code>TEEX</code> and <code>History</code>
        to make them easier to find later.  Later, when building a quiz based on that question bank,
        you can easily find all of the questions about TAMUS history by searching the
        <code>History</code> tag.  The below screenshots demonstrate how that is done.
    </p>

    <h3>Adding tags when creating or editing a question:</h3>

    <p>
    In the screenshot, I have added the tags <code>TEEX</code> and <code>History</code>  to this question, because it is a 
    question about TEEX history. The screenshot shows there are two ways to add tags. The "Official tags" list has some 
    pre-defined tags which other people have already used. It is good to select from pre-defined tags when possible.
    If no predefined tags matches, you can instead type in your own tags in the text box.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Searching questions using tags:</h3>
    <p>
    Suppose we are building a quiz for paramedics. In this quiz, we want to include some questions about various types of drugs.
    We can do this by clicking on the <code>Drugs</code> tag within the question bank as shown:
    </p>

    <img src="searchingtags.png" alt="screenshot of searching by tag" style="border: thin black solid;">
    <p>
    To select multiple tags, hold down the <code>Ctrl</code> key while clicking.
    Also visible in the screenshot above is the box to find questions that do NOT have certain tags. 
    As an example, that could be used to find questions about drugs that are not about aspirin.
    </p>

    <h2 id="bestpractices">Tagging best pratices</h2>
    <p>
       It is best practice to choose tags that are a) general and b) about the question itself.
       Keep in mind that in the future someone may want to use your tags to build a quiz for an entirely different course &mdash; 
       and that person may be you. For this reason, <code>Medications</code> is a better tag than
       <code>Chapter 15 - Medications</code>. Two years from now, you may be building a different course and have need for
       questions about medications, completely unrelated to whatever book "chapter 15" refers to.  The key here is that
       <em>the question itself</em> is about <code>Medications</code>, without reference to any particular course or anything else.
       The tag on the question tells us something about the question.
       Of course, this is only a general guideline. You may have a specific need to use tags in a different way. However, when 
       the tag is not about the question itself, consider using Categories or Outcomes instead. Categories and Outcomes are 
       discussed below.
    </p>

    <p>
        It is recommended that tags be short, most often a single word. <code>Actors</code> rather than 
        <code>Comedic actors of the 1980s</code>. This helps when using the tags later for searching. When looking for 
        actors, you are more likely to just enter the word "actors" rather than come up with the longer phrase.
        Just as important, it's actually more flexible to use two or three tags, <code>Actors</code>, 
        <code>1980s</code> &amp; <code>Comedy</code>.  In this way, if you later need to find questions about 
        actors, any actors, you can click the <code>Actors</code> tag.  If you want only 1980s actors, you 
        can click both <code>Actors</code> and <code>1980s</code>. Two short tags give you more flexibility than one long tag.
    </p>

    <p>
        Note in the above examples that tags are always plural, if the plural makes sense.
        We use <code>Actors</code>, not <code>Actor</code>. This avoids having some items marked 
        in the singular and some in the plural, creating unnecessary extra tags. Use the singular only 
        when plural doesn't make any sense. Plural <code>Barak Obamas</code> doesn't make sense, there is only one 
        Barak Obama, so we'd use the tag <code>Barak Obama</code>.
    </p>

    <h2 id="alternatives">Alternatives to tags - Question Categories and Outcomes</h2>
    <p>
       <strong>Categories</strong> are sometimes a better tool to use than tags. 
       Categories are used to organize questions into useful groups. Categories can have sub-categories.
       Categories are best when there is a natural hierarchy, meaning each question is in only one group. For example, 
       categories could be used in a biology question bank to organize questions about Animals -&gt; Mammals -&gt; Primates versus 
       Plants -&gt; Seed Plants -&gt; Conifers.  The important thing to note here is that no single item can be both a primate 
       AND a conifer. Categories are good for organizing into exclusive categories of this nature. Categories may be most useful
       when you want to organize based on something that is not an inherent property of the question itself, but rather 
       represent <em>groupings</em> of questions.  As discussed, <em>tags</em> are used to mark properties of a question. 
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Outcomes</strong> are designed to track student competencies in a required curriculum or set of standards.
        As an example, outcomes can be a better choice than tags when a curriculum standard specifies that students must 
        demonstrate competency in each of a list of skills. An elementary math curriculum might specify that the 
        quiz must include questions covering addition, substraction, multiplication, and division. Outcomes serve this 
        need well. For example, using outcomes you can see the student's average grade for addition questions, average 
        grade for subtraction, etc. Like categories, outcomes are hierarchical, so multiplication and division can be 
        grouped together under "math".  Unlike categories, outcomes are <em>not</em> exclusive, so one question could 
        be marked for both the <code>understands regulations</code> outcome <em>and</em> the 
        <code>understands safety rules</code> outcome.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Codified standards</strong> are another area where outcomes work well. If, for example, you are developing 
        a course on fire codes, outcomes are an ideal way to track that the course teaches each section of the fire code, 
        and test that students have learned each section of the code. Outcomes should be considered when the student needs 
        to learn each element of a structured, well-defined standard.
    </p>

    <p>
        Outcomes can also be associated with learning activities within the course.
        TEEX support for the full outcomes system is planned for the second half of 2014. As of early 2014, a more limited 
        version of outcomes is available. For detailed information about the upcoming outcomes system, see the 
        <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Outcomes_Logical_Overview">logical overview</a> and 
        <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Outcomes_Specification">specification documents</a>.
