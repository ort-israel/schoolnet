Version 0.0.2
Significant changes as a result of the first round of feedback!
  - Renamed parser classes to conform to coding guidelines
  - Moved all parser strings into a language pack
  - Switched a lot of double quoted string to single as per guidelines
  - added automatic formatted comments as required by coding guidelines
  - changed treatment of variable names to help reduce confusion. Now
    the first letter is treated as the name and the rest are subscripted.
    Greek letter names are treated as a single character i.e. theta1
    becomes \theta_{1} in LaTeX.
  - Added option to specify text which goes in front of response box
  - Added support for specified variable names in the parser to improve
    parsing in some situations e.g. 'xy' will now get treated as 'x * y' if
    there are two variables 'x' and 'y' defined.
Bug fixes
  - fixed bug when evaluating special constants in the parser
  - fixed incorrect rendering of sqrt in LaTeX by the parser
  - fixed incorrect sage-server.py file in the ZIP
