MOODLE ALGEBRA QUESTION TYPE
Created by Roger Moore

ORIGINAL README BY ROGER MOORE:

These files implement a algebra based question type for Moodle.
Installation instructions are found in the file INSTALL.

The code has been tested and used for a large, introductory physics
course (~120 students) at the University of Alberta for several
terms now and is stable and suitable for use in a production
environment.

The code is all released under the GPL V3.

Please send any bugs, comments, suggestions for new features etc.
to me.

Enjoy,

Roger Moore <rwmoore@ualberta.ca>
