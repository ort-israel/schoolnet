INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Before installation: Please note that this is ALPHA quality software at
the moment. DO NOT install this on your production server - or at least
don't blame me if you do and it all goes horribly wrong! 


REQUIREMENTS

To install the algebra based question type you will need the following:

1) Already installed copy of Moodle 2.3 or higher. It was tested with Moodle
2.3 and 2.4.

   
3) If you want to use the SAGE XML-RPC server you will also need XML-RPC
   support in PHP5. Most installations include this but the MAMP 1.7.1
   package does not. If you use MAMP you will need to download the MAMP 
   source code from the MAMP website and recompile PHP making sure you
   call the initial configure script with the flag "--with-xmlrpc".
   
4) If you want to use the SAGE XML-RPC server you will also need a copy of
   SAGE which you can get from here: http://www.sagemath.org/. This should
   be installed according to the instructions on their website.
   

INSTALLING

1) Copy the contents of the "algebra" directory into the question/type
   subdirectory of your moodle directory.
   
2) Go to Site Administration > Notifications and follow the usual procedure
   to upgrade a Moodle plugin. You are now ready to write algebra based questions
   which use the 'Evaluate' and 'Equivalent' comparison methods.
   
3) To run the SAGE XML-RPC server you will need an installed copy of SAGE
   (http://www.sagemath.org/). Edit the first line of the 'sage-server.py'
   file to point to your installed copy of the sage executable. Then simply
   execute the sage-server.py script. It will run a very simple XML-RPC
   server. If the machine you run your moodle server on is different from
   the machine running your SAGE webserver you will need to enter the full
   url
