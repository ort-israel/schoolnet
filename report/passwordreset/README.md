PasswordReset report
=============

This is a simple report which displays a link to user password reset for everyone enrolled in the given course.

Based on the roster report:
    git clone git://github.com/LafColITS/moodle-report_roster.git report/roster

Install by uploading the folder to the report folder in Moodle's root folder.
Then visit the admin screen to allow the install to complete.

Once the plugin is installed, you can access the functionality by going to
Reports > PasswordReset within the course.

Beneath each user will be a link to reset the password.
