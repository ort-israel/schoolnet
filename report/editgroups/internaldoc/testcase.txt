Initial Setup
=============

You need one test course with a few activities (fewer than 20), and one test
course with many activities (more than 20), including at least one of each type.
In both courses, make sure you have some ground and groupings set up.

Test script
===========

1.  In the small course, go to Administration -> Reports -> Grades.
2.  At the top will be an 'Activity type' selector. This should be set to 'All activities'.
3.  Then there will be a form with a section at for each course section containing
    relevant activites. In each section will be all the groups settings for each
    activity.
4.  Change some settings here, then go to the standard edit settings page for that
    activity, and ensure that the changed settings have been saved.
5.  Change some group settings in the standard activity settings from, go back to
    the edit dates report, and ensure the updated dates are shown there.
6.  Now go to the report for the large course. The report will automatically
    swtich to only show one type of activity, to stop the form from being too big.
7.  Switch through each activity type, and ensure that the groups settings in the
    report have exactly the same set of groups settings as in the standard
    activity settings form. Specific things to check are:
    * which settings are displayed.
    * that the disabled-if dependencies between the settings for each activity are
      the same as on the editing form.
