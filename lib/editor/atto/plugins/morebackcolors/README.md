# More font background colors for Atto

Modification of the backcolor plugin allowing the Moodle admin to define colors


##Â New in version 1.2 (2015101200)

 - you can now have several rows of colors, not just one single column : in the plugin settings, just enter several space-separated hex color codes per line -- thanks to Abu Zakaria!

 - if allowed in the plugin settings, users can now use a color wheel to set their own colors -- thanks to jinhofer


## Installation

Install the plugin directory as usual in lib/editor/atto/plugins.

Then visit Site Administration > Plugins > Atto > More font background colors to define the colors you want your users to be able to chose from.

Finally, enable the plugin by adding 'morebackcolors' (without the quotes) in the Atto toolbar settings.
