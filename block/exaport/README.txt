* exabis ePortfolio Block - Description *

This block can easily be added to a Moodle installation and provides ePortfolio functionality for each student and teacher. Students can build up their ePortfolios collecting weblinks, files and notes within an individually defined system of categories. Artefacts can be assembled in views that can be published to specific target-groups (the teacher or students within the Moodle-installation or directly to internet users) get reflections and comments submitted by other persons as well as import uploaded assignments from within the Moodle-installation. 
In addition the ePortfolio can be saved as a SCORM-package which is a standardized scheme and file format for the transportation of learning-based data and can be used cross-platform for further work.
If the module exabis competences is installed in addition ePortfolio-users can also categorize artefacts within given educational standards documenting their work in working on these competences.

* exabis ePortfolio Block - Disclaimer *

As with any customization, it is recommended that you have a good backup of your Moodle site before attempting to install contributed code.
While those contributing code make every effort to provide the best code that they can, using contributed code nevertheless entails a certain degree of risk as contributed code is not as carefully reviewed and/or tested as the Moodle core code.
Hence, use this block at your own risk.

* exabis ePortfolio Block - History *

In August 2011 exabis ePortfolio was associated with Exabis Competence Grid Block. This enables ePortfolio-users to categorize their artefacts with educational standards. These standards are linked to Moodle via the exabis-competencies Block (download at: http://www.moodlekurse.org/course/view.php?id=65) with an associated XML-file. The XML-file can be generated with any tool, gtn gmbh has made available a tool as a Typo3-extension which can be downloaded at: http://gtn-solutions.com/fileadmin/gtn/downloads/T3X_exabis_competences-1_0_1.t3x
In April 2011, gtn gmbh (http://gtn-solutions.com) updated exabis ePortfolio to be compatible with Moodle 2.0-versions. This was done with kind support of Gerente de Sistemas y Tecnologías, UNIVERSIDAD TECNOLÓGICA DE CHILE – INACAP.

Originally exabis ePortfolio was developed in the year 2007 with kind support of the Federal Ministry of Education in Austria. It was then certified as the first Moodle-Block that was reviewed by the Moodle-core team (Peter Skoda).
